Basic object oriented programming exercises


Lab-1:	Write a program to round off an integer “i” to the next largest multiple of another integer “j”. For example, 256 days when rounded off to the next largest multiple divisible by a week results into 259.

Lab-2.	A number is entered through the keyboard. The number may contain 1,2,3,4, or 5 digits. Write a program to find the number of digits in the number.

Lab-3.	Write a program which finds a four digit number AABB which is a perfect square. A and B represent different digits.

Lab-4.	Write a program of Factorial through recursion.

Lab-5.	Write a program which takes a string as input from user and returns the length of that string.

Lab-6.	 Write a pointer version of the function strcat (s,t) copies the string t to the end of s.

Lab-7.	Write the function strend(s,t), which returns 1 if the string t occurs at the end of the string s, and zero otherwise.

Advance practice problems :
1.	Write a program to detect and remove Loop in a Linked List.
2.	Write a program to find K’th Smallest/Largest Element in Unsorted Array 
3.	Write a program to evaluate postfix expression.
